    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 2024</p>
    
    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Our Commitment:</strong> ClickMemory is built on the principle that your data belongs to you. We do not collect, store, or access your personal information or snippets.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>ClickMemory is designed with privacy-first principles. We do not collect, store, or process:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your text snippets or code fragments</li>
        <li>Your API keys or credentials</li>
        <li>Your browsing history or website data</li>
        <li>Personal information or identifiers</li>
        <li>Usage analytics or tracking data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How Data is Handled</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> All data processing occurs locally in your browser</li>
        <li><strong>Your API Keys:</strong> Data is stored using your own API keys and credentials</li>
        <li><strong>No Server Storage:</strong> We do not have servers that store your data</li>
        <li><strong>Direct Communication:</strong> The extension communicates directly with your chosen storage service</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect or store your data, there is no risk of data breaches on our end. However, you should:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Keep your API keys secure and private</li>
        <li>Use strong, unique passwords for your accounts</li>
        <li>Be aware of the privacy policies of the services you use to store your data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>ClickMemory may interact with third-party services (like your chosen storage provider) through your API keys. We do not control these services and are not responsible for their privacy practices. Please review the privacy policies of any services you use.</p>

    <h2>5. Browser Permissions</h2>
    <p>The extension requires certain browser permissions to function:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Active Tab Access:</strong> To read selected text from web pages</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> To save your API keys and settings locally</li>
        <li><strong>Network Requests:</strong> To communicate with your storage service</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These permissions are used only for the stated purposes and are not used to collect personal information.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect your data, there is no data retention policy on our end. Your data retention is controlled by the services you choose to use for storage.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect your personal data, traditional data subject rights (like deletion requests) do not apply. However, you can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Uninstall the extension at any time</li>
        <li>Clear your browser's local storage to remove saved settings</li>
        <li>Revoke API keys from your storage service</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>ClickMemory is not intended for use by children under 13. Since we do not collect personal information, we do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify users of any material changes through the extension or our website.</p>

    <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us through the extension's support channels.</p>

    <div class="warning">
        <strong>Important Note:</strong> While we do not collect your data, the privacy of your information ultimately depends on the services you choose to use for storage. Please review their privacy policies and security practices.
