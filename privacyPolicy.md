# Privacy Policy - ClickMemory

**Last updated:** December 2024

## Our Commitment

ClickMemory is built on the principle that your data belongs to you. While your data is stored securely in Supabase, we do not access, view, or use your personal information or snippets.

## 1. Information We Do NOT Access

ClickMemory is designed with privacy-first principles. While your data is stored in Supabase, we do not access, view, or process:

- Your text snippets or code fragments
- Your API keys or credentials
- Your browsing history or website data
- Personal information or identifiers
- Usage analytics or tracking data

## 2. How Data is Handled

- **Secure Storage:** Your data is stored securely in Supabase using your own API keys
- **Your API Keys:** Data access is controlled entirely by your own API keys and credentials
- **No Data Access:** We do not access, view, or use your stored data
- **Direct Communication:** The extension communicates directly with Supabase using your credentials

## 3. Data Security

Your data is stored securely in Supabase, but we do not have access to it. To maintain security:

- Keep your API keys secure and private
- Use strong, unique passwords for your accounts
- Be aware that Supabase's security practices protect your data

## 4. Third-Party Services

ClickMemory uses Supabase as a storage provider. While we do not access your data stored there, please review Supabase's privacy policy and security practices. We are not responsible for Supabase's privacy practices.

## 5. Browser Permissions

The extension requires certain browser permissions to function:

- **Active Tab Access:** To read selected text from web pages
- **Storage:** To save your API keys and settings locally
- **Network Requests:** To communicate with Supabase

These permissions are used only for the stated purposes and are not used to collect personal information.

## 6. Data Retention

Your data retention is controlled by your Supabase account settings and your own data management practices. We do not control or access your stored data.

## 7. Your Rights

Since we do not access your personal data, traditional data subject rights (like deletion requests) do not apply to us. However, you can:

- Uninstall the extension at any time
- Clear your browser's local storage to remove saved settings
- Manage your data directly through your Supabase account
- Revoke API keys from your Supabase account

## 8. Children's Privacy

ClickMemory is not intended for use by children under 13. Since we do not access personal information, we do not knowingly access information from children under 13.

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify users of any material changes through the extension or our website.

## 10. Contact Us

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us through the extension's support channels.
